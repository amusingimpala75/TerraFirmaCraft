# TerraFirmaCraft: The Next Generation
*TFC: TNG*

This project is the official port of TerraFirmaCraft (the original, also called classic) to Minecraft 1.12 and beyond.

You can find the mod on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfcraft), or stay updated by joining our [Discord](https://invite.gg/terrafirmacraft), and see documentation on the [Wiki](https://tng.terrafirmacraft.com/Main_Page).

## Goal

- The ultimate goal of this project is to be **the** TerraFirmaCraft for 1.12+, not a mere partial imitation.
- The idea is to stay faithful to the original where possible, but also improve the various systems and allow for better cross-mod compatibility and integration.

## Contributing

 - Firstly, join our [Discord](https://invite.gg/terrafirmacraft), as it's where all discussion surrounding development, tasks, and decisions happens.
 - As per the Github terms of service, you grant us the right to use your contribution under the same license as this project.
 - In addition, we request that you give us the right to change the license in the future.
 - Import & use the project's Code Style. (Recommend using Intellij as that's what our code style xml is based on)
- Before creating a Pull Request, run `gradlew updateLicenses`. This will apply the correct license header to all project files.
- We use python for data and asset generation, among other things. In order to run the generation scripts (all found in `/resources`), you will need to install the python modules `mcresources`, `pillow`, and `nbtlib`.
